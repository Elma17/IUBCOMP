Multiple competitions are held in IUB through which the students polish their extracurricular talents.
Currently, the only ways for them to virtually represent their talents are through the IUB website which
focuses on academics and groups on Facebook which is popularly used in South-East Asia but not
globally. In order to increase morale and productivity, we must find a way to present their achievements
more cohesively

A cohesive web application IUBComp will allow categories for different websites to handle different
competition requirements. It will become the go-to website for students wanting to present their
achievements and a portfolio of the extracurricular competitive environment at IUB. It will also make
common contests such as photo and art contests easier to hold through the website
